# Gradient-Boosting
Building a Gradient Boosting Classifier

Using my knowledge of Gradient Boosting to build a classifier from scratch and comparing against a Python Gradient Boosting library. 

The data was from the UCI ML Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from https://goo.gl/U2Uwz2, which was designed to use predictive attributes to find breast cancer.

The algorithm is a simplified version of the Gradient Boosting algorithm with some changes in order to reduce time necessary to build it.

Results produced from the self-built model and the built in library model proved similar. 

| **Model**    | **Train Classification Accuracy** | **Test Classification Accuracy** |
|--------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Built In     | 100.00%                           | 95.18%                          |
| Self-built   | 93.55%                            | 92.54%                          |
